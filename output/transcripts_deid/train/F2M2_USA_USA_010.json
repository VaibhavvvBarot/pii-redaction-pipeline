  "original_text": "It's really hard to discuss color. Well, I guess it kind of goes back to basics, right? Like being in school. They always had like a song about your colors. Don't sing the song. Don't sing the song? No, don't sing the song. I won't sing the song just for you. But then, you know, there's always primary colors, right? So red, green, blue, whatever those other ones are. It's a rainbow, right? Are those primary? I don't feel like violet's a primary color. No. Blue, green, red, and yellow. Yep, yellow was in there. Because with those colors, you can make all the other colors, right? Right. And then you have the rainbow. Right. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and to go violet. You got it. I know. But you probably don't even remember what that was for, right? What do you mean, what it was for? Like, why do we memorize that? Like, what the purpose of Ruegie Biv was? No. It was the spectrum of color. It's how your eye receives it. They're different wavelengths. So, like, the strongest ones are the ones at the top. So, like, red, orange, yellow. Yeah, that's why, like, the rainbow, as you always see, those predominant colors first. And then if it's a good rainbow, you would see, like, the violet and the indigo. And if it wasn't, if the light wasn't strong enough, you would only see the other colors. I guess that's there. I know that's some fun facts for you, right? Yeah. Whether it's true or not, we'll never know. No, because I don't remember that, but we learned, you know, colors in kindergarten. So, what was your favorite color? Like, do you remember growing up? You were like, this is my color. No. No. I've never, I honestly don't have a favorite color. Never had a favorite color. No. No. Man, that's tough. See, I was always a blue guy. I loved blue. And he used to be dark blue. That was my jam. And then somewhere around teens, it turned into green. I'm not sure why. Probably for a girl. Everything was for a girl in high school, right? And then I remember after high school, it was more of a light blue. I guess the colors got lighter. Light blue, dark blue, you know, it was still blue, but it wasn't the same. No, right. Yeah, I don't have a favorite. I like teal. Teal, that's like green or blue. No, I think it's more on the blue spectrum. Teal. That's a super light blue, right? It's like seafoam almost. No, a little darker than that. But yeah, you think you're in the general area. See, I like, I don't know. I like darker colors. No, I think I think I went back. I like those really dark colors like the magenta. I don't really like black. I've never liked black. No, and you know, girls are supposed to like pink when they're little. I didn't care for pink, but I didn't care for purple, but I didn't like blue or green, you know, like, I guess I feel about them all equally, because I don't have one that I hate either. Yeah, no, I really don't have a lot of colors. I necessarily hate. I guess there's certain objects I wouldn't want a specific color on. Like, I wouldn't want my color pink, or I wouldn't want my floor to be like orange or something. I can't wear orange. It looks makes my skin look like orange. No, it just makes my skin look weird. But I don't dislike the color because of it. I still like orange. You know what? I saw a guy with a lavender tie and like a light, light blue shirt, and it looked really good, and I never thought lavender would be a color I liked. But that was pretty slick, so I guess I'm with you. I don't really have any colors I don't like necessarily, and I don't really have any favorites. I kind of love them all. And they really should stop asking people what their favorite color is. I think you force people to choose. You do. It's more of a personality question. Did you know that? They face a lot of the personality questions down on shapes and colors, and by using those, they can separate you out into three or four different groups. I don't know what they'd say about me. I just don't care.",
